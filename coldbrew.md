## Cold Brew

#### You need

- A sealed jar
- Roughly 11 grams of coffee per 100 ml water (.9 oz of coffee per 1 cup water) 
  (Kenyan and Ethiopian coffees are particularly great for this)
- A fridge
- A paper filter or kitchen towel

#### Instructions

1. Grind the coffee to your liking, but not too fine. You'll regret a fine grind
   when it comes to filtering the brew
2. Put coffee in jar, pour cold water on top
3. Give it a good stir
4. Seal the jar
5. Put in fridge for 12 to 24 hours. After a while it doesn't really matter how
   much longer you let it steep.
6. Take brew out of the fridge, give it a good stir.
7. Filter the brew. This will take a while with a paper filter (V60) and may get
   a bit messy. Depending on how much you've brewed, you may need more than one
   filter. A viable alternative is a kitchen towel, though I have yet to try
   this myself.


#### Alternative

1. Grind the coffee to your liking, but not too fine. You'll regret a fine grind
   when it comes to filtering the brew
2. Wrap coffee in an unfolded chemex filter (having multiple layers hinders extraction) and fixate with a rubber band (use 2 filters if
   you have a big jar)
3. Put coffee in jar, pour cold water on top
4. Seal the jar
5. Put in fridge for 12 to 24 hours. After a while it doesn't really matter how
   much longer you let it steep.
6. Get the wrapped coffee out and throw it away. Enjoy cold brew! The resulting
   brew is a bit more mild than the original variant and a lot less messy to make.
   I originally had some concerns about the rubber bands affecting the taste but
   at least for large quantities (> 1 liter) I haven't noticed anything.
