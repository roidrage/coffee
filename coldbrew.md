## Cold Brew

#### You need

- A sealed jar
- Roughly 11 grams of coffee per 100 ml water (.9 oz of coffee per 1 cup water) 
  (Kenyan and Ethiopian coffees are particular great for this)
- A fridge
- A paper filter or kitchen towel

#### Instructions

1. Grind the coffee to your liking, but not too fine. You'll regret a fine grind
   when it comes to filtering the brew
2. Put coffee in jar, pour cold water on top
3. Give it a good stir
4. Seal the jar
5. Put in fridge for 12 to 24 hours. After a while it doesn't really matter how
   much longer you let it steep.
6. Take brew out of the fridge, give it a good stir.
7. Filter the brew. This will take a while with a paper filter (V60) and may get
   a bit messy. Depending on how much you've brewed, you may need more than one
   filter. A viable alternative is a kitchen towel, though I have yet to try
   this myself.
